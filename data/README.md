# ADS Project 1: R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

'lyrics.csv' can also be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3tfv5v73z0ec8vr/lyrics.csv?dl=0

"lyrics.csv" is a filtered corpus of 100,000+ song lyrics from MetroLyrics. Available features are song name, year, artist, genre, and lyrics. You can find the complete 380,000+ song lyrics data on Kaggle.
